# Hi, I'm olg!

**they/them or no pronouns**

This is where I put in my personal projects. 

My projects so far are basically glorified s\*\*tposts, because that's how I learn best. 

I also try my best to demostrate what I was trying to do with my projects, because as some wise person said, the best way to learn something is to teach it. I hope you enjoy my projects, and I'll surely be pleasantly surprised if you ever find it useful or amusing! 😄

I'm currently learning RegEx, SQL and Python because I'll be using them for my job.

You can reach me through Discord at olg#6328 or through Twitter at [@olg6328](https://twitter.com/olg6328)!
