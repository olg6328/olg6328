# Hi, I'm olg!

**they/them or no pronouns**

This is where I put in my personal projects. 

My projects so far are basically glorified s\*\*tposts, because that's how I learn best. 

I'm currently learning RegEx, SQL and Python because I'll be using them for my job.

You can reach me through Discord at olg#6328 or through Twitter at [@olg6328](https://twitter.com/olg6328)!
